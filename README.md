# my-project
This project is not my main work. It’s not something extraordinary or highly polished.  However, this is a small project I created for fun, as part of pursuing my dream of becoming a programmer.  My coding skills are still developing, so if you have any suggestions or feedback, I would sincerely appreciate it.
