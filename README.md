# my-project
This project is not my main work. It’s not something extraordinary or highly polished.  However, this is a small project I created for fun, as part of pursuing my dream of becoming a programmer.  My coding skills are still developing, so if you have any suggestions or feedback, I would sincerely appreciate it.

You can try
1. Only Python 3.10+
2. pip install pygame-ce
3. run python file

Don't forget
pip install -r requirements.txt
Cause it correct version for my code
